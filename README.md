# EigenCloud App Ideas

## 1. Sovereign Journalist
**Category:** Verifiable News  
**Description:** A sovereign journalist is a completely independent agent that goes and tries to collect data, and anyone can come and verify their identity. For example, I am someone who works at X and I want to whistleblow Elon. That's something I can do now. Why the sovereign agent? Because no one's gonna censor it and everything's in TEE, so this never gets out of who actually whistleblowed it.

**Problem:** Currently, it is hard for people to actually whistleblow because someone knows about this. In a real-world case, the journalist will know who the whistleblower is, and the only thing stopping him from telling his business friends who fund him is his moral integrity. But, as we have seen in the past, people have lost integrity, and journalists try to be the money-hungry suckers they are.

**Solution:** Solution is already mentioned in the description. We have the agent running in a TEE, in our compute environment. Anyone can come verify that they work at XA or something based on the email or HR provider through ZKTLS and later whistleblow people. Super simple. The journalist/agent is supposed to ask the person questions and get the truth out and try to investigate more to make sure that the person is not given fake information. I think this can go pretty quick.

**Value Proposition:** The journalists can later sell ads or something else, but the biggest value prop is now everyone is getting completely verified news with no one censoring this journalist because everything is immutable and on the blockchain.

## 2. Memecoin Allocation
**Category:** Memecoins  
**Description:** Allocate memecoins based on social signals.

**Problem:** Memecoin allocation on social isn't fair or verifiable.

**Solution:** Use verifiable memecoin allocation through EigenCompute + EigenAI.

**Value Proposition:** We take care of the core verifiable infrastructure.

## 3. Private Advanced Vaults
**Category:** DeFi  
**Description:** Vaults right now have limited computational ability. Offchain isn't trusted.

**Problem:** Low scalability.

**Solution:** Use EigenCompute to run more advanced vaults.

**Value Proposition:** We take care of building trust around the solution.

## 4. Verifiable Debate
**Category:** Gaming  
**Description:** Verifiable Debate lets two or more parties argue while an AI judge scores them against a transparent rubric. Every step runs in attested compute and emits a tamper-evident record.

**Problem:** Internet debates are decided by vibes, moderator bias, and brigading. There's no reliable audit trail or way to settle bets, grants, or decisions off the back of a debate.

**Solution:** Run the judge and rubric inside EigenCompute TEEs, publish the prompt, inputs, and scoring function, and produce a signed attestation for the verdict. Tie the verdict to onchain payouts, bounties, or governance actions.

**Value Proposition:** Fair, replayable outcomes you can actually pay on. Teams get a drop-in primitive for truth-finding, competitions, and procurement decisions without trusting a person or platform.

## 5. OpenFront w/ Betting
**Category:** Gaming  
**Description:** Verifiable Execution + Betting.

**Problem:** OpenFront's real-time economy, alliances, naval combat, and nukes create complex, high-stakes matches, but there's no trust-minimized way to settle wagers or tournament prizes on outcomes or in-game milestones. Community reports of scripts/cheats and opaque moderation make high-stakes play and betting risky.

**Solution:** Run the match simulation and bet-settlement logic inside EigenCompute; emit per-tick hashes and a final signed result so inputs→outputs are auditable, then escrow and auto-pay bets on-chain from that attestation. Offer a public spectator feed and simple markets (e.g., "first nuke used," ">30% territory at 5m," "win by elimination") that all reference the same attested trace. Or just simple wagering.

**Value Proposition:** Players and organizers get anti-cheat, provably fair payouts without trusting a mod or platform, unlocking real money tournaments and granular side-markets. For OpenFront specifically, it monetizes the game's signature beats—trade routes, naval pushes, and nuclear plays—while preserving speed and flow.

## 6. Compatibility Match
**Category:** Dating / Social  
**Description:** Private Agent that reads your and other's ChatGPT context and finds out what you guys like and would be good icebreakers. See your compatibility as partner, friend or colleague.

**Problem:** People have rich context (chat histories, notes, calendars, "about me" blurbs) but it's scattered and private. Icebreakers and "are we a fit?" checks require reading that context, which today means either oversharing raw data with an app or trusting a black-box model. Without proof of what was accessed and what was computed, both sides worry about creepiness, leaks, and manipulation. Result: weak intros, low reply rates, awkward meetings, and zero organizational appetite to deploy this at scale.

## 7. Private Code Reviewer Agent
**Category:** Security & IP  
**Description:** Private agent that reviews code and finds out backdoors and ways for people to RUG your money.

**Problem:** Currently - teams keep their codebase private for security and IP reasons (for example, hyperliquid), but at the same time - it requires to have trust in the people and you have huge counterparty risk.

**Solution:** What if?! u have a private agent that reviews code for backdoors and any kind of rug functionality while keeping the code private.

**Value Proposition:** Removes levels of counterparty risk without disclosing business logic.

## 8. Verifiable Private Model Evals
**Category:** AI  
**Description:** You privately upload the model weights to the platform -> we run evals without leaking your weights.

## 9. Airline Miles Marketplace
**Category:** Trading

**Value Proposition:** Eliminates those risks with Compute.

## 10. Dark Pools
**Category:** Trading  
**Description:** Dark Pool, powered by TEEs.

**Problem:** Dark Pool are used for 40% of the securities block trades and the crypto alternative only has $1million 24 hour volume (but it also supports decently liquid assets).

**Solution:** Run it with TEEs.

**Value Proposition:** Private Trading without giving your information ("tell").

## 11. Sovereign AI Scientist
**Category:** Science  
**Description:** Independent AI research agents.

## 12. Liquid Memecoin + Agent
**Category:** Trading  
**Description:** You always set a sell price, you pay proportional of the sell price to the creator. You can build non-toxic because everyone knows when they will sell. You need an agent to set higher sell price if you don't want to sell. That's why we need active token management. Active strategy needed to trade all these memecoins. People set policies on this platform.

## 13. Token-Distribution Based on Verifiable Attributes
**Category:** Airdrop  
**Description:** Only people from India can buy, or only people from India can get an airdrop. If you are 1 year old Uber user, give them a token. If you are a GitHub wizard. have an agent that allows you to adjudicate that GitHub contributions. People can bootstrap users (like TikTok incumbering).

## 14. Identity Incumbering
**Category:** Identity  
**Description:** One platform which owns TikTok, Facebook, etc. People can give delegated access to other people to do activities on your behalf. For example, you go and like a post. It allows you to build a complete unnatural bot.

**Problem:** Letting others help across platforms usually means password sharing or brittle scripts, which is insecure, non-revocable, and often against terms. You can't set granular limits (who, what, when, how much) or see exactly what was done on your behalf.

## 15. New Lotto
**Category:** Private Casino  
**Description:** A "hot–cold" lottery: before a round starts, a verifiable compute enclave (TEE) generates and seals a 12–N digit target number. Players submit guesses. After each guess, the enclave returns a deterministic "distance" hint (e.g., how many digits are correct/in-place or a numeric distance). When a guess is sufficiently close, the enclave marks that state and automatically raises the buy-in (globally) to slow brute force and grow the pot. First exact match wins the entire pool; all logic, state, and payouts are enforced by the enclave.

**Problem:**
- Fairness & trust: In normal guessing games, the operator could change the target after seeing guesses or fudge hints/prices. Players have no way to verify fairness.
- Information leakage abuse: Hints make search tractable, but also invite bot swarms and collusion unless rules are enforced exactly as specified.
- Operator discretion risk: Dynamic pricing ("near → higher buy-in") is game-critical, but if controlled off-box it becomes arbitrary or exploitable.
- Auditability: Regulators and players need a clean, tamper-evident trail proving the number was fixed from the start and all hints/prices were computed by the same code.

**Solution:**
- TEE-sealed game logic: The target number is generated by a hardware RNG inside the TEE and sealed with a round ID. Code is remotely attested so anyone can verify the exact rules (distance function, near-thresholds, pricing curve, payout).
- Deterministic hints: The enclave computes closeness using a published, fixed metric (e.g., Hamming matches or absolute numeric difference) and returns only that hint—no operator override.
- Rule-bound dynamic pricing: When hints cross a pre-defined "near" threshold (e.g., distance ≤ k), the enclave automatically applies the buy-in increase according to a public formula (e.g., step or curve), preventing discretionary gouging.
- State & payout in enclave: All round state (hash of target, guesses, hints, pricing steps) is logged with enclave signatures; winner detection and payout execution are performed by the enclave, producing a verifiable audit trail.

**Value Proposition:** Players get a provably fair, tamper-resistant guessing game where all hints and price changes are computed by an attested enclave, creating real suspense and bigger pots without house meddling. Operators gain built-in trust and higher engagement via a simple API, while the enclave enforces rate limits and payout logic to block abuse and reduce operational risk. Regulators and partners get deterministic rules plus signed audit trails for every round, cutting disputes and compliance overhead.
